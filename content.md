## About Omnifood

We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.

## About Divine World
 I love to take challenge. I was born in 4th August 1999. My name
              is Dipesh Paudel. I am an exception. I understood that when I was
              14. I am passionately curious and obsessed with science,
              technology, stars, sports, spiturality and list goes so on and so
              forth...
              <br />
              <br />
              And I have solution for people lagging behind in early age.
              <br />
              <br />
              I have a vision and solutin for people who are struggling!


I am Dipesh Paudel with vision for development of this country, with major focus on our youth and childrens. I have a vision to provide real life -high income skills, personality development, network building, public speaking and proper communication skills and moral education. Bring change in outdated education system and shape the future of this country.
Further, to bring change in other fields I have proposed
-Divine Cafe and Restaurant for fooding.
-Divine Book Store also E-Book stores for educational purpose.
-Divine Sport Academy for Football and Cricket to keep youth and children busy in sport and safe from drugs and bad company.
-Divine Sports  for affortable sports kits and sport materials.
-I am under the research of electirc charging station and eco friendly activities we can do to keep our environment safe for us and also for upcoming new generation




Most people are very busy with their jobs, family, friends and other activities. We all know we are using less then 10% of education we learnt in school and college. Just school and college education is not enough to secure the future of students because they are outdated syllabus and excess work. Because of busy life it doesn't leave much time for thinking about future of children.
 With proper research and facts I have designed the education system that is useful for students in their real life. Just with these skills they can target to achieve big dreams and achieve for real.
But I dont stop there,  partnering with other educational schools, colleges  and institution to bring change in education system and deliver quality and refined education to most of the students. All this will be packed up in a course structure, students can choose one or more course they are interested to develop their career in and work on it under experts guidance. -->
